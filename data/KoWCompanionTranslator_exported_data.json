Note an Aura may have a further qualifier, in which case the Aura will only grant the special rule to the unit with that name or keyword in addition to the unit with the Aura itself. Effects of Auras of the same type are not cumulative. So, for instance, a unit covered by two Aura (Thunderous Charge (+1)) do not gain Thunderous Charge (+2). Units only gain special rules that affect melee or ranged combat (such as Brutal, Elite, Crushing Strength etc.) if they are within the Aura when the combat is being resolved. Units only gain special rules that affect movement (such as Pathfinder, Strider, Wild Charge etc.) if they are within the Aura at the beginning of their movement.",

Les effets des auras de même type ne sont pas cumulatifs. Ainsi, par exemple, une unité couverte par deux auras (Charge tonitruante (+1)) ne bénéficie pas de Charge tonitruante (+2). Les unités ne bénéficient des règles spéciales affectant le combat au corps à corps ou à distance (comme Brutal, Élite, Force écrasante, etc.) que si elles se trouvent dans l'aura au moment de la résolution du combat. Les unités ne bénéficient des règles spéciales affectant le mouvement (comme Éclaireur, Grands pas, Charge sauvage, etc.) que si elles se trouvent dans l'aura au début de leur mouvement.",

Some people even go to the next level, and glue their models directly onto the tray, without first placing them on their individual bases. We refer to these solutions as ‘multi-bases’. Multi-bases are very useful, but make sure that the multi-base itself conforms to the correct size for the ranked up models as if they were mounted onto their individual bases. To continue the example above, you could mount the 20 Elf infantry models directly onto a 100x80mm multi-base.",
